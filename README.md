# 🎬 CineMatch

> *"Finding your next favorite movie, one recommendation at a time."*

CineMatch is a **content-based movie recommendation system** built using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-learn**. It recommends movies with similar genres by applying **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** on the MovieLens dataset.
